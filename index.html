                          Howdy! My name is Louis Salamone. I'm born and raised in Ohio in a small river-side town that has a very 
                          small population, and eventually left home at 18 to attend Ohio University as an Audio Engineer and Music
                          Industry major.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          My time in Ohio and especially at OU were fantastic - but upon graduating, it was time for a new chapter 
                          - and I landed a job at a recording studio in Denver, CO, which is kind of an ideal situation as I had a few 
                          friends out yonder and am super involved in the outdoors.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          My audio involvment is primarily music recording as well as mixing and mastering - being lucky enough to work on projects all around the country with some amazing engineers. I feel very lucky for the life I have!
