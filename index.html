                          Howdy! My name is Louis Salamone. I'm a born and raised mid-westerner that surrounds himself with music and technology. Currently, I am working as the second engineer at Blackwater Audio, where I work with artists to record, mix and master their projects from start to finish. Also, I am enrolled in University of Denvers Full-Stack Web Development program to further my knowledge and love for web developement, and potentially evolve into software development as well.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          I take full advantage of every opportunity that I am offered, I have been able to participate in heaps of hands-on experiences and landed very professional industry involvement due to credible knowledge, familiarity and dependable work ethic.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Since moving to Denver over 2 years ago and working a multitude of production gigs - as well as from the experience that I’ve gained through my career in the studio and all of the outlets I’ve been able to associate with, what lures me in the most isn’t the vanity or the perpetual recognition of my production, but rather for the creative work itself and the process that goes behind it. Curating the best possible product for the client that they and I can be immensely proud of is far more important and is a constant reminder why I chose this path.
